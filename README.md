# Project: Predicting Risk of Experiencing Cardiovascular Disease

## Condensed Summary:

•   This project involved using python to develop two different sparse regression models: 1. LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage & Selection Operator and 2. Forward Stepwise Selection. Both these models were developed to be less complex and more flexible than a Multiple Linear Regression model by using less predictors in the formula the models use to calculate the likelihood of a patient experiencing cardiovascular disease.

•   This project also involved using the two newly developed sparse regression models to rank each of the 13 predictors and find the most important factors in determining the likelihood that a patient experiences cardiovascular disease.

•   For this project, medical data for 1024 patients (each with 13 predictors and 1 outcome) was processed to create a clean dataset that was used to train both sparse regression models and K Fold Cross Validation was applied using this clean training dataset to optimize both models.
